You have not yet designated any disk partitions as type Linux.

Linux cfdisk will select a default device when called without 
arguments. If you don't want to partition the default device, 
then call fdisk with the device you want as the argument, like 
this: 

fdisk /dev/hdb

or this: 

fdisk /dev/sda 

------------------

Make sure there are no pre-existing partitions if 
you are performing a fresh install of just Linux.

Then make at least 2 partitions for Linux, and try setup again.
Make one partition to take up all but what should be left over for 
the swap partition (like virtual memory on Windows.) 

The space to leave for swap should be 100MB to 1024MB, 
it can vary considerably without any bad side-effects. 
As an example -- if you had a 10000 MB drive, you could make the 
first partition about 9,600 MB. 

The default type is Linux (83), so that is OK.
Make sure to set it as BOOTABLE.


Make the second partition out of the remaining space.
Change the type to SWAP.
Linux swap is tagged as type 82.

When done, be sure to WRITE the new table.
Then Quit

If you have changed any old DOS partitions, you should reboot and start 
setup all over again. If not, you can just type setup and move on.
